        <public_access_description>The fascination with gold never ceases. Rejected when the avant-garde was experimenting with alternative materials, gold returned to favour in the 1990s. Innovative concepts in treating gold were developed as never before.

            Jacqueline Mina is known for her innovative and pioneering use of gold. She creates surfaces that are naturally patterned and sensual in feel. One of her pioneering techniques is fusion inlay with platinum and gold.

            In the foreword of a catalogue to the exhibition &#39;Or Gold&#39;, which she curated in 2004, she wrote: &quot;I know from my own practice that gold as an artistic medium is an undeniably versatile metal and that many imaginative artists choose to use it for its limitless physical possibilities. In addition to the appreciation of its natural characteristics they find that their jewellery is endowed with an allure that is carried down from antiquity in the collective subconscious.&quot;</public_access_description>

        <physical_description>A chain of delicate gold circles, arranged in pairs and linked together by the larger wishbone-shaped elements of gold enamelled in either grey-blue or white. There is an outer line of wishbones and an inner one, and a third line in between at right angles which link the two rows of gold circles. Thus each wishbone has two circles passing through the hole near its upper edge, and each gold circle has three wishbones attached. A large faceted rose-quartz drop forms the central pendant; at the back the clasp consists of two flat rings of gold, one of which is cut to allow the other to pass through it. The enamelled wishbones create a fringe-like effect and the linked construction, where nothing is fixed in one position, gives a sense of movement and flexibility.</physical_description>

        <public_access_description>Ralph Bakker uses traditional materials and techniques to create work of great delicacy, complexity and beauty. Each of the necklace’s repeating wish-bone forms is cut from a flat sheet of gold which is then enamelled. The ingenious inter-linking of this simple form creates structure, giving the effect of a dense and luxuriant, yet very light, fringe.

            This necklace is one of forty-five pieces of jewellery given to the V&amp;A from the collection of the late Louise Klapisch.</public_access_description>

        <public_access_description>This monumental design was created by Nicholas Georgiadis for Verdi&#39;s opera Aida, produced at the Royal Opera House in 1968.  It is typical Georgiadis in both its  architectural feeling (he originally trained as an architect) and severe geometric decoration.  While the cloaks and tunics could be adapted to several contexts, the characteristic nemes headcloth firm sets the period as Egyptian.
            Georgiadis was famous for his expensive designs.  The costumes were built up of layers of appliqué, which created an impression of luxury and sumptuousness.  The &#39;riot&#39; of geometric shapes are held in check by the subdued colours, the dull green and browns, highlighted by gold and bronze, suggesting strength and masculinity.
            Georgiadis&#39;s influence on stage design in the mid 20th century was immense and few designers who passed through his stage design classes at the Slade School escaped untouched.</public_access_description>

        <public_access_description>Zoe Arnold (born 1981) is a British artist jeweller and sculptor whose work, often inspired by her poetry, combines figurative elements with unusual minerals and found materials. Her  work is visually intriguing with meanings hinted at obliquely. Her style is distinctive  and inventively eclectic, drawing on an extensive array of materials and themes. Her work often combines poetry and collage to create striking, sculptural objects.

            This ring is set with two gold flies flanking a rectangle of bright green garnet  crystals. It relates to her poems ‘The Destiny of Flies’ and ‘Hope’ – which present a  rather dark view of humanity’s yearnings and searching. In &#39;The Destiny of Flies&#39;, she describes :

            &quot;A vast array of silent dancing soldiers,
            How they turn and waltz their last upended hours,
            While others pass,
            Unhindered, into the day.&quot;

            The green field above which the flies hover is made of uvarovite garnet. The pattern on the flies&#39; wings was made by pressing leaves into the gold.</public_access_description>

        <public_access_description>Wendy Ramshaw, (b.1939), one of the most significant British 20th century jewellers, made a gold lapel pin for Dan Klein which unfortunately never got delivered since he died unexpectedly just before it was finished.  She has given this pin to the Museum in his memory.  Dan Klein was known particularly to the Ceramics &amp;amp; Glass Collections over many years.  He was an acknowledged expert in the 20th century decorative arts, firstly through his gallery in Motcomb Street, then as Head of Decorative Arts for Christie’s, Europe and finally as Executive Director of Phillips de Pury.  He gave several objects to the V&amp;amp;A collections, including a sugar bowl and cover made by Rosenthal AG, 1908, an earthenware plate with painted and printed decoration, designed by Graham Sutherland and made by Arthur Wilkinson &amp;amp; Co, ca. 1933-34, a Moby Form of glass, gold and enamel by Richard Meitner, Amsterdam, 1997,  and a cut and polished glass form, Sublime Transmission, by Sally Fawkes and Richard Jackson, England, 2008.  He was above all, a specialist in contemporary glass.  The gold pin is exquisitely made and elegantly designed as one has always expected from Wendy Ramshaw.

            Wendy Ramshaw&#39;s career is remarkable.  She has decisively shaped and influenced contemporary jewellery of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Wendy Ramshaw’s design vocabulary can be described as a mature, revitalised version of modernism whose values have so much shaped 20th century architecture and the fine and decorative arts.  She has received; an OBE and CBE from the Queen and in 1999, she was made a Royal Designer for Industry.</public_access_description>

        <history_note>Some time in the 1980&#39;s Dan Klein asked me if I would consider making him a lepel pin as a commission but, somehow, between the two of us, it never seemed to get either designed or made, although Dan and I stayed in touch.

            As well as his considerable expertise in the decorative arts, developed firstly through his gallery in Motcomb Street, then as Head of Decorative Arts with Christie&#39;s, Europe and finally as Executive Director of Phillips De Pury, Dan, was above all, a specialist in glass; its history, design and manufacture.

            Many years after the pin conversation, Dan wrote an essay for my 2007 exhibition, &lt;i&gt;Journey Through Glass&lt;/i&gt;, held at The Scottish Gallery, in Edinburgh.  He was very interested in the pieces in the exhibition; both the table top pieces and the jewellery.  He came along to a photographic sessions and discussed the work with me on many occasions.

            He introduced me to his niece Juliet who lived in the USA and I subsequently created a large gate for her home in New Jersey, which was shipped across to the States and installed in the driveway of her house.  It was coloured a soft shade of grey and is one of my favourite large scale gates.

            Finally I made the little gold pin as a gift for him but before I could give it to him, he died of cancer.

            His passing seemed very sudden and the pin remained with me.  The Metalwork Department of the Victoria and Albert Museum has agreed to accept the pin into the Museum collection.  This makes me happy because it now has a home to his name.

        <public_access_description>Jacqueline Mina is known for her innovative and pioneering use of gold. She creates surfaces that are naturally patterned and sensual in feel. One of her innovations is the fusion inlay with platinum and gold. She continues to push the boundaries of goldsmithing techniques to find a new expression, as here with her combination of gold and titanium.

            Titanium was a new material developed through experiments in the space industry. Its iridescent colour, achieved through heat or electrical currents, attracted the attention of jewellery designers, such as Mina.

            Jacqueline Mina writes in the foreword of a catalogue to the exhibition &#39;Or Gold&#39;, which she curated in 2004: &quot;I know from my own practice that gold as an artistic medium is an undeniably versatile metal and that many imaginative artists choose to use it for its limitless physical possibilities. In addition to the appreciation of its natural characteristics they find that their jewellery is endowed with an allure that is carried down from antiquity in the collective subconscious.&quot;</public_access_description>

        <public_access_description>In the 1960s jewellery developed an abstract, sculptural character, with a wide range of visual effects. The traditionally polished surface of gold was no longer fashionable, and instead jewellers played with flame and heat to create new textures and surface finishes.

            Gilbert Albert studied at the Ecole des Arts Industriels, in Geneva. He was designer at Patek Philippe from 1955 - 1962. Today Albert has shops in Zurich and Geneva. He is ten times winner of the Diamonds-International Award and has exhibited worldwide. In 1999 he founded the Geneva Jeweller&#39;s Museum (Musée des Cabotiniers Genevois).

            Typical of his work in precious metals are the elaborately textured surfaces in asymmetric compositions, often inspired by nature and set with high quality gemstones.</public_access_description>

        <public_access_description>This piece is part of the Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection. Every year from 1987 to 2006, while David Watkins was Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the RCA, he invited four jewellers and silversmiths from outside Britain to give a week-long masterclass. The artists brought diverse skills, aesthetics and approaches. The first call on their time was to interact closely with the students. In addition, although concentrating on their teaching and working in an unfamiliar studio, each artist generously made an object for the RCA&#39;s collection. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, now transferred to the V&amp;A, is a major document of international contemporary jewellery, a tribute both to the artists and to the vibrancy of the RCA as a teaching institution.

            Jewellers of the late 20th century found new ways of drawing out gold&#39;s natural beauty. By exploring surface treatments and textures they created an effect very different from the bright metallic glint of polished gold. They restored an elemental simplicity and grandeur to this most enduring of metals.

            A stark effect is achieved in the minimalist geometry of Graziano Visintin’s jewellery. Narrow facets with minimal volume, as seen here, are typical of his designs. These narrow segments form the basic elements of his compositions. The severity is tempered by a fine texturing of the gold surfaces.

            Visintin studied at the State Institute of Art ‘Pietro Selvatico’ in Padua, under Giampaolo Babetto.</public_access_description>

        <public_access_description>David Watkins (born 1940) is renowned as one of the most influential European artists in jewellery, and was from 1984 to 2006 Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork &amp; Jewellery at the Royal College of Art, London.

            He began his career in the 1960s as a sculptor, jazz pianist and special effects model maker. These influences feed into his jewellery, which is all about form, rhythm and colour. He has explored a wide range of materials, from paper to gold, encompassing industrial materials such as acrylic, steel, aluminium and titanium. For him machine technologies and hand skills can both bestow beauty, thus traditional craft and modern technologies coexist without loss to one another.

            The delicate, geometric frame of the circle or wheel divided into twelve segments is a feature of all the pieces in the &#39;Wheel Pin&#39; series, and evokes his ladder pins of the late 1970s. Watkins&#39; customary minimalism is somewhat moderated in these pieces by the addition of  decorative elements, abstracted forms from nature, which cross and soften the rigid precision of the underlying form.</public_access_description>

        <public_access_description>Michael Becker works primarily in gold, often in sheet form which he builds into repeating linked geometric elements and to which he gives a matt texture. His fascination with ‘structures which form the basis of objects, and the hidden networks of these structures’ is evident in the rectangular links of the necklace and the discreet hinging which connects them so flexibly. (Michael Becker quoted from the World Gold Council website)

            This necklace is one of forty-five pieces of jewellery given to the V&amp;A from the collection of the late Louise Klapisch.</public_access_description>

        <public_access_description>This delicate gold and diamond ring was bought from the Oxford Gallery in 1969 to celebrate the engagement of author and museum curator Crispin Paine and economist Suzanne Maiden. The ring is made of 18 carat gold and shaped into a dynamic zigzag, very evocative of the 1960s. Susan Phillips McMeekin, the ring&#39;s maker and designer studied textiles and jewellery at Harrow Art School before training as a goldsmith at the Royal College of Art, graduating with First Class honours in 1955. She spent a year as a designer for a Philadelphia jewellery firm then became a staff designer for Whitehorn Jewellers, Hatton Garden, London. In the 1970s, she moved away from making jewellery to designing for the firm of McCabe McCarty and has since designed tableware, clocks, jewellery and objets d&#39;art for royalty and heads of state around the world.</public_access_description>

        <public_access_description>This piece is part of the Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection. Every year from 1987 to 2006, while David Watkins was Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the RCA, he invited four jewellers and silversmiths from outside Britain to give a week-long masterclass. The artists brought diverse skills, aesthetics and approaches. The first call on their time was to interact closely with the students. In addition, although concentrating on their teaching and working in an unfamiliar studio, each artist generously made an object for the RCA&#39;s collection. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, now transferred to the V&amp;A, is a major document of international contemporary jewellery, a tribute both to the artists and to the vibrancy of the RCA as a teaching institution.

            Jewellers of the late 20th century found new ways of drawing out gold&#39;s natural beauty. By exploring surface treatments and textures they created an effect very different from the bright metallic glint of polished gold. They restored an elemental simplicity and grandeur to this most enduring of metals.

            Georg Dobler studied goldsmithing in Pforzheim, but soon moved to Berlin. The urban architecture of the city was to make a lasting impression on his work. He was fascinated by geometry, structures, spaces, lines, and Constructivist art. Dobler’s wire structures form linear planes and volumes, expressing solids or voids. Recently he has moved from these geometric structures, as seen here, to organic forms taken from nature and represented in gemstones.</public_access_description>

            HEADDRESS FOR THE EAGLE GOD IN GARUDA
            1966

            Garuda was one of Ram Gopal’s most popular dances from the time of his first appearance in London in 1939. In the performance, the Eagle God makes a daily journey to the heavens to obtain amrit, the food of the gods. The helmet, with overlapping gold leather ‘feathers’ and the gold metal lotus motifs, represents the winged eagle.

        <public_access_description>Ram Gopal was one of the most important dancers of the 20th century and certainly one of the most exotic theatre performers.  He was a major figure in the revival of Indian dance and his spectacular theatrical presentations introduced it to audiences both  in Asia and the West. He was proud of the authenticity of his music, costuming and style, shrewdly tailored his presentations to Western audiences, using modern theatrical techniques and spectacular presentation.

            This costume was worn by Gopal in The Eagle Dance, one of his most famous solos; in it he portrayed Garuda, the sacred golden eagle of Lord Vishnu, whose mission was to destroy the Naga (snake) people, for which Vishnu rewarded him with immortality.  The costume is made of gold leather, cut into &#39;feathers&#39; and lotus shapes, trimmed with brilliant blue, and under the stage lights would have shone with a sun-like radiance entirely fitted to a servant of a god.

            Such costumes were expensive, some were insured for as much as £25,000, and they had to be carefully looked after. Thus, the wings and headdress for this costume had specially designed carrying cases to protect them on the long journeys between engagements.</public_access_description>

        <historical_context_note>Ram Gopal (1917-2003) and Uday Shankar, were the most important Indian dancers of the 20th century. Gopal built on Shankar’s pioneering revival of Indian dance and its introduction to audiences both in Asia and the West, taking it one stage further. He remained faithful to the pure discipline, technique and ethos of Indian classical. but he also started to open out a deeper appreciation of Indian classical dance traditions, shrewdly tailored to Western audiences, using modern theatrical techniques and spectacular presentation.  He widened audiences experiences by including music and other folk and classical styles alongside his own pieces. Each item was preceded by an explanation, enabling audiences to understand and appreciate what was, at that time, a very esoteric art form.
            For three decades he was a major world star, with a glamour and charisma equal to any other major dance star of the period. He not only raised public awareness of the richness of Indian dance but worked with dancers trained in other dance forms, like Alicia Markova, thus setting a precedent in Britain for the current thriving and creative South Asian dance scene, which mixes classical Indian dance with other contemporary and classical dance styles to create something uniquely itself.
            Each of Gopal’s costumes was hand made and tailored to his own design. He spent huge sums on his costumes, which could be insured for as much as £25,000.  Some were made of cloth of gold, woven and tailored in India; when it became worn, it was sent back to India, melted down and rewoven.</historical_context_note>
